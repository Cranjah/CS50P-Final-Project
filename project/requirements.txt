Dear User,


First of all you must be sure, that Python3 is installed properly on
your computer including the package management tool PyPi:

Visit https://www.python.org/ for instructions and further downloads; 

I'm using the following libraries in my final project via import, so
please make sure they are all installed on your system:

sys
random
pyfiglet

(and eventually pytest for testing the program - but there is no need)

You can in case install the libraries via pip install command in your
terminal window, following this command patterns:

CMD: pip install pytest
CMD: pip install pyfiglet

or for macOS:
CMD: pip3 install pytest
CMD: pip3 install pyfiglet

The sys and random library should be preinstalled with your version
of Python3, so theoretically you don't need to pip install those.

Also make sure you download the public repository properly via GitHub
and especially make sure you download the file "project.py"!

To start the program in your terminal, please open the folder, which
contains the program, in your terminal and run one of these commands:

CMD: python project.py --math10 
CMD: python project.py --math30
CMD: python project.py --rps10
CMD: python project.py --rps30
CMD: python project.py --sentences10
CMD: python project.py --sentences30

or for macOS:
CMD: python3 project.py --math10 
CMD: python3 project.py --math30
CMD: python3 project.py --rps10
CMD: python3 project.py --rps30
CMD: python3 project.py --sentences10
CMD: python3 project.py --sentences30

Each of these commands runs a different brainjogging game, so have fun!

For each given task type in your answer directly into the terminal and
hit the enter key on your keyboard to confirm your answer.

After completing all tasks you will be given a final result and score.

Kindest Regards,


Marc-Michel MÃ¼nch
