Dear User,


I'm using the following libraries in my final project via import, so
please make sure they are all installed on your system:

sys
pytest
random
pyfiglet

You can in case install the libraries via pip install command in your
terminal window, following this command patterns:

CMD: pip install pytest
CMD: pip install pyfiglet

The sys and random library should be preinstalled with your version
of Python3, so theoretically you don't need to pip install those.

Kindest Regards,


Marc-Michel MÃ¼nch
