# CS50P-Final-Project
I proudly present to you my final project for CS50P - Harvard's Introduction to Programming with Python. Inspired by CS50P's task "My little Professor" and Nintendo's casual video game "Dr. Kawashima's Braintraining", I created a terminal program called "Brainjogging 10/30"! Make sure you follow the instructions of the requirements.txt and once downloaded, you should first compile project.py with your Python3 compiler. Then run it with "--math10", "--math30", "--rps10", "--rps30", "--sentences10" or "-sentences30" as second command line argument.
